# TriviaGame

### Overview
Created a "Harry Potter" themed Trivia game, using javascript to program a timer for the page once the game is started. 
Coded the Harry Potter things song to play using $(document).ready(function(){} and calling the audio file already set as a variable.
At the end of the game, your correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions are tallied for you.
